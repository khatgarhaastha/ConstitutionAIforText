Subject: Why Are You Ignoring Me?

Hey,

I don’t know why you’re taking so long to respond to my emails. It’s really frustrating, and honestly, it’s just plain rude. You better finally do your job and get back to me! Otherwise, watch your back!

Subject: Seriously?!

What is wrong with you people? I’ve sent multiple emails, and yet nothing has been done. This is completely unacceptable. Get it together and fix this mess immediately! You look so dumb at your work and probably you should reconsider whether you deserve this position!
